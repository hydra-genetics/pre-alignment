# [Prealignment module](https://github.com/hydra-genetics/prealignment)

The prealignment module consists of alignment pre-processing steps, such as trimming and merging of `.fastq`-files
as well as filtering out rRNA sequences from RNA reads. We **strongly** recommend trimming `.fastq`-files
prior to alignment. For rRNA filtering, SortMeRNA can additionally be used.

# [Hydra-genetics](https://hydra-genetics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

We are an organization/community with the goal of making [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) pipeline development easier, faster, a bit more structured and of higher quality.

We do this by providing [snakemake modules](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/modularization.html#modules) that can be combined to create a complete analysis or included in already existing pipelines. All modules are subjected to extensive testing to make sure that new releases doesn't unexpectedly break existing pipeline or deviate from guidelines and best practices on how to write code.
